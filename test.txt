Testing :::: Based on mininet topologies 

LINEAR TOPOLOGY 


	 sudo mn --controller=remote --switch=user --topo=linear,5
	 
	 
	 Test Case 1 : Have config updated in switch two. 
				   Rules installed in 3 and 4 only. 
				   Provided there is no loop between 3,4 - 2 then we perform a one touch. 
				   
				   Test passed. 
				   
	Next install a rule in 2 to forward packets to one. 
	Now try and update switch 2. 
	Test fails.
